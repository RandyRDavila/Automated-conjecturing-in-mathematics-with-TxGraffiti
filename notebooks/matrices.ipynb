    "# Matrix Conjectures with TxGraffiti\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/matrices.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on square symmetric matrices. Matrices are fundamental in various areas of mathematics and applied sciences, including linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning. By examining the relationships between different matrix properties, TxGraffiti aims to uncover new mathematical insights and conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of square symmetric matrices with various numerical properties such as:\n",
    "- **Numerical Properties**: Trace, determinant, second largest eigenvalue, Frobenius norm, condition number, and condition number times Frobenius norm.\n",
    "- **Boolean Properties**: Is positive definite, is sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of square symmetric matrices.\n",
    "- Identify significant relationships and patterns in matrix properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to generate the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the fascinating properties of square symmetric matrices and discover new mathematical conjectures with TxGraffiti.\n",
