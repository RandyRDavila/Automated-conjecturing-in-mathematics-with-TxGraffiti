    "# Integer Conjectures with TxGraffiti\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RandyRDavila/AI-discovery-in-mathematics-with-TxGraffiti/blob/main/notebooks/integers.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the application of the TxGraffiti algorithm to generate conjectures on integer data. Integer sequences and properties form the basis for many famous mathematical conjectures, such as Goldbach's conjecture and the 3n+1 problem. Here, we explore how TxGraffiti can be used to discover new relationships and patterns in integer properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of positive integers and includes various numerical and boolean properties such as:\n",
    "- **Numerical Properties**: Sum of digits, number of divisors, square root, and factorial.\n",
    "- **Boolean Properties**: Primality, even/odd status, and Goldbach property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate conjectures relating different numerical properties of integers.\n",
    "- Identify significant and non-trivial relationships between integer properties.\n",
    "- Apply the Theo and Static Dalmatian heuristics to filter and refine the conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the cells to generate the dataset and apply TxGraffiti.**\n",
    "2. **Examine the generated conjectures and their significance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the power of TxGraffiti in uncovering hidden patterns in integer data.\n",
